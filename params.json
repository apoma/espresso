{"name":"Espresso","tagline":"The ESPResSo package - Plumed 2.0 enhanced ","body":"### Welcome ESPResSo package. A Plumed 2.0 enhanced version.\r\n\r\nThis is a fork from the [ESPReSso project](http://espressomd.org/) which is intended to integrate the  [Plumed 2.0 code](http://www.plumed-code.org)into ESPReSso package.\r\n\r\nPlumed 2.0 is intended to give enhanced sampling capabilities to ESPResSo molecular dynamics engine.\r\n\r\nIt is still experimental, so use it at your own peril.\r\n\r\nThe [documentation of Plumed 2.0](http://plumed.github.io/doc-v2.0/user-doc/html/index.html) is on Github as well. It is regularly updated.\r\n\r\nIn order to compile it you should download the package and checkout the plumed branch\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
